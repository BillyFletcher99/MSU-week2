------MY PERSONAL PORTFOLIO------

Welcome! This is my first attempt at a professional web development page; From here i would like to make things bigger and better as i go along,
and hopefully eventually get some clients using this as a starting piece. 

--HOME SECTION--
![home](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/105595889/172066818-c39b8bc1-4f04-441a-8b2d-78b53ff0526e.png)
The above was quite a process to get to; I had to restart the project in whole twice i believe, in order to really start getting a idea of what to do in terms of layout for the page.
The nav bar is fully interactive, and will take you to the correct section; It also has a small but nice hoover effect to it as well. It primarily serves to indroduce the audiance to my page.

--ABOUT--
This section was rather small, as i don't have to much to say at the moment. It has a pciture for me that i condensed into black and white to better fit the vibe of the 
over all page. It has a berif description of myself as well.

--PORTFOLIO--
This section is mostly as a place holder, until I can get furhter in the course and swap out the placeholder pictures, with actual acomplished projects. 
They are somewhat interactive as well, hoovering over them will change the opacity some and highlight the picture. 
Again, i don't really have anything applicable to put here, so these are just place holders.

--SERVICES AND CONTACT--
![services and contact](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/105595889/172066834-1f71e6ec-3551-466b-8c42-875e52c404dd.png)
Finally, the bottem half of the page is just a simple run up of "services" i could offer thus far; I don't have much on there besides my
little CSS and HTMl knowledge, so primarily for now i would be able to assist in hypotheical web design. 
The contact box is fully workable, and will send a request or message straight to my email as well.

I think this was a good step in the right direction for this page, i am very excited to add more to it as i expand my knowledge more in the subjects,
Hopefully this is a good start for the page.
